# hypercube
In comuputation networks there exists the idea of broadcasting. Broadcasting in comunication network is the process of message dessimination within a network. There is an type of boradcasting called messy broadcasting which reduce the required information of topology of the graph. There are three types of messy broadcasting, model 1, model 2 and model 3.
The worst broadcasting time under the messy broadcasting model 1 in n-cube hypercube is not defined. Only the upper and lower bounds are known. Several papers have been published on this issue. However each of them has merely improved the upper or lower bounds of broadcasting.
