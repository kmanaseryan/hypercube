# hypercube
In communication networks there exists the idea of broadcasting. Broadcasting in communication network is the process of message dessimination within a network. There is an type of boradcasting called [messy broadcasting] (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tomhart/broadcasting/messy.html) which reduces the required information of about the topology of the graph (network). There are three types of messy broadcasting, model 1, model 2 and model 3.
The worst broadcasting time under the messy broadcasting model 1 in n-cube hypercube is not defined. Only the upper and lower bounds are known. Several papers have been published on this issue. However each of them has merely improved the upper or lower bounds of broadcasting.

The aim of this project is to run the algorithm of messy model 1 broadcasting for several times and gather statistical information. That information will help to determine whether the actual broadcasting time is closer to upper or lower bounds in most of the cases that the algorithm is being run.
